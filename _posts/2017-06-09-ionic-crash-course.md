About a week ago, I've subscribed to a mailing list from [Devdactic](https://devdactic.com/) to get the FREE 7 Day Ionic Crash Course.

Here are the topics per day as discussed during the week-long course**:
* **DAY 1**: Get started with Ionic
* **DAY 2**: Build a Tab Bar navigation
* **DAY 3**: Make HTTP calls to a REST API
* **DAY 4**: Store Data inside your app
* **DAY 5**: Use Cordova plugins
* **DAY 6**: Style your Ionic app
* **DAY 7**: Debugging
* **DAY 8**: ???? (Yup! There's 1 more free topic! You might want to subscribe to know!)
